**What is the question you hope to answer?**
Can we predict what type of crime occurs in Seattle based on neighborhood characteristics, such as public transit stops and types if businesses present?

**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**
*   [Active Business Licenses](https://data.seattle.gov/Finance/2016-Active-Business-License-Data/x6ke-uptm)
*   [Seattle Police Department Police Report Incident](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-Police-Report-Incident/7ais-f98f)
*   [King County Metro](http://developer.onebusaway.org/tmp/sound/gtfs/modified/1_gtfs.zip)

**What do you know about the data so far?**
These data sets are all very large and span over a long period of time. The business licenses are current up until June 2016, while the Police Data is updated every few days. Business licenses are broken out by category. The police indcidents are broken down by type of crime committed.

**Why did you choose this topic?**
I picked this topic mainly out of curiousity. I have read articles about other cities finding crime hotspots around liquor stores and/or bus stops and I was curious to know if there was any similar patterns in Seattle.
